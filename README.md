✅ Features
 - Accepts video URLs as input

 - Extracts and processes audio using moviepy and pydub

 - Converts audio to text and features using speech_recognition, librosa, and transformers

 - Uses a pre-trained model for accurate accent classification

 - Outputs the detected accent with high confidence

✅ Status
This project runs perfectly and has been tested successfully with multiple video URLs. It consistently returns accurate accent classifications, making it suitable for integration with media analytics or language education tools.
